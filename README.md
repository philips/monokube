# k9

k9 is a single binary that includes everything you need to run kubernetes locally. It also includes functionality that allows you to set up ssh tunnels to nodes, making it painless to setup a properly functioning cluster. This is particularly useful if you want to use kubernetes as an alternative to tools such as puppet or ansible for initial host bootstrapping. 


## Install

```
$ wget http://...
$ chmod +x k9
```

`kubectl` is included with binary too and can be accessed by creating a symlink to the original binary:

```
$ ln -s ./k9 ./kubectl 
```

## Basic Master


At this point `k9` is your complete master control plane and can be started with:

```
$ ./k9
...
```

Once running, test it out with kubectl

```
$ ./kubectl version
Client Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"1", GitVersion:"v1.1.4+$Format:%h$", GitCommit:"$Format:%H$", GitTreeState:"not a git tree"}
Server Version: version.Info{Major:"1", Minor:"1", GitVersion:"v1.1.4+$Format:%h$", GitCommit:"$Format:%H$", GitTreeState:"not a git tree"}
```

## Cluster setup

k9 can optionally setup ssh reverse proxy tunnels to nodes running the kubelet, making it painless to setup a secure cluster. Additionally it will invoke the kubelet with the right command line args to connect to the tunnel.

```
./k9 --nodes=host1.mylab:22,host2.mylab:22
```

### Example using Vagrant

Grab [coreos-vagrant](https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant) and edit `config.rb` to set `$num_instances=3`, then from the `coreos-vagrant` directory:

```
vagrant up
```

`coreos-vagrant` will bring up the nodes with static IPs, so you can use them to target using the `--nodes` flag on `k9`. 

```
./k9 --nodes=172.17.8.101:22,172.17.8.102:22,172.17.8.103:22
```

Now check that the nodes came up with `kubectl`

```
./kubectl get nodes
NAME           LABELS                                STATUS    AGE
172.17.8.101   kubernetes.io/hostname=172.17.8.101   Ready     1s
172.17.8.102   kubernetes.io/hostname=172.17.8.102   Ready     1s
172.17.8.103   kubernetes.io/hostname=172.17.8.103   Ready     0s
```
